      <h1>History</h1>
    
        <p>The first ever match Argentina played was against Uruguay, on 20 June 1902.[note 3] The game, which was the first international for both sides, was held in Montevideo, and Argentina won 6–0.[4][7] During the first years of its existence, Argentina only played friendly matches against other South American teams. The reasons for this varied, including long travel times between countries and the interruption due to World War I.[15]</p>
        <p>La Albiceleste has appeared in World Cup finals six times, including the first ever final in 1930, which they lost 4–2 to Uruguay. Argentina won their next final in 1978, beating the Netherlands 3–1. Eight years later, in 1986, Argentina led by Diego Maradona won their second title with a 3–2 victory over West Germany. Under the guidance of Maradona, they reached the final again, in 1990, but ultimately lost 1–0 to West Germany, by a much-disputed penalty. Led by Lionel Messi, Argentina reached the final in 2014, where they were beaten 1–0 by Germany in extra time. In 2022, again under the captaincy of Messi, Argentina won their third World Cup, beating France 4–2 on penalties, following a 3–3 draw after extra time.[16] The team's World Cup–winning managers are César Luis Menotti in 1978, Carlos Bilardo in 1986 and Lionel Scaloni in 2022.</p>      
        <p>Argentina has also been very successful in the South American Football Championship, the Copa América, winning it 15 times, a record it shares with Uruguay; they were crowned champions most recently in 2021. The team also won the inaugural FIFA Confederations Cup in 1992 and the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions in 1993 and 2022.</p>      
        <p>In March 2007, Argentina reached the top of the FIFA World Rankings for the first time.[17]</p>

      <h1>Home stadium</h1>
          
          <p>Argentina plays most of its home matches at River Plate's stadium, Estadio Monumental, in Buenos Aires,[18][19] although the team also uses various other venues frequently, such as Estadio Único Madre de Ciudades[20][21] and Boca Juniors' stadium, La Bombonera.[21] Those venues, along with Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes and Estadio San Juan del Bicentenario,[22] were used for the 2022 World Cup qualification.[23] Additionally, Argentina played some matches at Rosario Central during their 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign.</p>
          <p>GEBA Stadium was the first stadium Argentina used for its home matches; that includes the Copa Newton match against Uruguay held on 13 September 1908,[27] which has a historic significance for being the first time Argentina wore the light blue and white-striped jersey in an official game, which has since then been the defining uniform up to the present day.[28] GEBA was also used for the Copa Centenario Revolución de Mayo, the first competition held between South American national teams, considered the predecessor of Copa América, organised by the Argentine Football Association (AFA) in 1910. Most recently, Argentina played at GEBA on 19 October 1919, winning the Copa Premier Honor Argentino after a 6–1 victory over Uruguay.</p>      
          <p>Argentina has also been very successful in the South American Football Championship, the Copa América, winning it 15 times, a record it shares with Uruguay; they were crowned champions most recently in 2021. The team also won the inaugural FIFA Confederations Cup in 1992 and the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions in 1993 and 2022.</p>      
          <p>In March 2007, Argentina reached the top of the FIFA World Rankings for the first time.[17]</p>
